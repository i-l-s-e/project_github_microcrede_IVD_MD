# Fork and Clone
You can fork a remote repository for which you are not a collaborator directly on the GitHub page of such repo. You will then be able to clone it to your local repository using `git clone <repo link>`on your terminal. 

If you are indeed a collaborator of a git project, you can directly clone it to your local repository.
